During my apprenticeship, also known by the nickname \"Master Bling-Bling\", my urge to delve deeper and deeper into the subject grew. Growing up during the time of mobile change helped me. So \"mobile first\" and \"responsive design\" are not foreign words, but part of the standard.",

To speed up the development of the individual components, I have been using TailwindCSS for many years. On the following pages I explain what I thought about when designing the individual elements. The source code is of course publicly available on GitHub.",
